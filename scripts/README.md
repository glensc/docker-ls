About registry-ls
=================

The author of Docker-ls refused patches with those shell scripts on top of
docker-ls, so here they are.

They are very useful if you want to do shell scripting on top of them.

Note: this script will only work with this patched version of docker-ls, as
of today, the mayflower's one does not support the env var
DOCKER_REGISTRY_URL, see https://github.com/mayflower/docker-ls/pull/8

Usage
=====

In order to use those scripts, you need to set first the address of the
registry as an environement variable:

```
$ export DOCKER_REGISTRY_URL="https://mydocker.registry.com"
```

Screenshots
===========
